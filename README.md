## How To Use
Create an `input` and `output` folder and put all the textures in the `input` folder, and run the script to generate the uglified textures.

## How It Works
Uglifier modifies textures through several steps:
* Pixel Spreading: randomly swaps nearby pixels.
* Hue Shifting: alters color tones and increases saturation.
* Noise Injection: adds some random noise to pixels.
* Color Reduction: lower color resolution for textures.
