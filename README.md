## How To Use
Create an `input` and `output` folder and put all the textures in the `input` folder, and run the script to generate the uglified textures.

## How It Works
Uglifier modifies textures through several steps:
* **Pixel Spreading:** randomly swaps nearby pixels.
* **Hue Shifting:** alters color tones and increases saturation.
* **Noise Injection:** adds some random noise to pixels.
* **Color Reduction:** lower color resolution for textures.
